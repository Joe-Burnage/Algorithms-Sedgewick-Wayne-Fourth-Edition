Suppose that a[] and b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of
integers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient?
int[] t = a; a = b; b = t;

The code fragment swaps the integer arrays a[] and b[].
It is efficient as it does not handle the elements in the array, only the
reference values. The size of the arrays is irrelevant.
