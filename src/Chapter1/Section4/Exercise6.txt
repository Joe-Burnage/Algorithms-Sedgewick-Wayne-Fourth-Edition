Give the order of growth (as a function of N) of the running times of each of the
following code fragments:

a. int sum = 0;
for (int n = N; n > 0; n /= 2)
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sum++;

Order of growth will be linear

b. int sum = 0;
for (int n = 1; n < N; i *= 2)
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        sum++;

Order of growth will be linear

c. int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < N; i *= 2)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
        sum++;

Order of growth will be linearithmic
