Analyze ThreeSum under a cost model that counts arithmetic operations (and
comparisons) involving the input numbers.

Accounting for arithmetic operations and comparisons within the inner loop of ThreeSum
(    if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k] == 0)    )

We have two additions and a comparison. This gives us three operations each time
we process the inner loop, leading to an approximation of ~N^3/2 operations.
