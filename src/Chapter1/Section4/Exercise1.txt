Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is
precisely N (N - 1) (N - 2) / 6. Hint : Use mathematical induction.

Base case:
N = 3

There is only one way to choose a triple from three items.
3 * 2 * 1 / 6 = 1

The base case holds.

Induction Hypothesis:
Assume the formula holds for some arbitrary N = k, i.e.
k choose 3 = k (k - 1) (k - 2) / 6

Induction Step:
We must show that the formula holds for N = k + 1, i.e.
k + 1 choose 3 = (k + 1) k (k - 1) / 6

If we consider the set of k + 1 items, we can form triples in two ways,
1. Choose 3 items from the first k items.
2. Choose 2 items from the first k items, and the third item is the (k + 1)th item.

Our induction hypothesis tells us that the first of these ways is given by
k (k - 1) (k - 2) / 6

The number of ways to choose two items from the first k items
(the third item is predetermined, and doesn't add any variability)
is given by k choose 2, which is equal to
k (k - 1) / 2
Therefore the number of ways to choose 3 items from k + 1 items is
k + 1 choose 3 = k choose 3 + k choose 2

Using the induction hypothesis and the binomial coefficient formula, we get
k + 1 choose 3 = k (k - 1) (k - 2) / 6 + k (k - 1) / 2

Simplifying this expression, we get
k + 1 choose 3 = k (k - 1) (k - 2) / 6 + 3k (k - 1) / 6

k + 1 choose 3 = k (k - 1) (k - 2) + 3k (k - 1) / 6

k + 1 choose 3 = k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k + 3k^2 - 3k / 6

k + 1 choose 3 = k^3 - k / 6

k + 1 choose 3 = k (k - 1) (k + 1) / 6

Thus we have proven the formula holds for k + 1, and the hypothesis has been proven by induction.
