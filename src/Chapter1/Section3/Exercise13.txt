Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue) enqueue
and dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put the integers 0 through
9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value.
Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?

a. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      could occur

b. 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1      could not occur
   ^
c. 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0      could not occur
   ^
d. 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9      could not occur
   ^

Since we are working with queues (FIFO), the first element in (0) must always
be the first out. The only possible return output is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.
