Forbidden triple for stack generability. Prove that a permutation can be generated
by a stack (as in the previous question) if and only if it has no forbidden triple (a, b,
c) such that a < b < c with c first, a second, and b third (possibly with other intervening
integers between c and a and between a and b).

Suppose that there is a forbidden triple (a, b, c). Item c is popped before a and b,
but a and b are pushed before c. Thus, when c is pushed, both a and b are on
the stack. Therefore, a cannot be popped before b.

For example, if a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

To have a stack where we can pop c, we must push everything up to and including c.
Stack: 3 2 1
If we pop c, we are left with the stack
2 1
We cannot pop a before b, thus the permutation 3 1 2 is impossible, as it contains
a forbidden triple.
