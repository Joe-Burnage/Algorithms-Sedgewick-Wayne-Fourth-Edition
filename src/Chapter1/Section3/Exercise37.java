/*
Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire
straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They
arrange themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle,
eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus
figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that
takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order in which people are
eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
